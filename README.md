 AI-Powered Fake News Detector
 
• An AI-based web application that detects fake news from input text using a fine-tuned BERT model.  
Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with a clean and interactive Gradio UI.

• key Features

- Detects whether a given news statement is real or fake.
- Built using a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on a fake news dataset.
- Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces using Gradio for easy accessibility.
- Simple, interactive UI for testing multiple news inputs.
- Returns predictions in real-time with high accuracy.
- Supports dynamic input and handles exceptions gracefully.
  
•  What I Did in This Project

- Collected and preprocessed a labeled fake news dataset.
- Fine-tuned a BERT model using Hugging Face Transformers.
- Built a Gradio interface to allow user input and real-time prediction.
- Deployed the complete application on Hugging Face Spaces.
- Applied NLP techniques for tokenization and text classification.
- Integrated model evaluation using accuracy and F1 score.
- Ensured clean UI/UX for non-technical users to interact with the model.
